# PHP Wrappers for Various NOAA APIs

This is a collection of unofficial wrappers around different NOAA APIs.

They are not endorsed by NOAA.

## Installation

**NOT READY** This collection is not ready for production use.

If you do want to play with it, you can use [Composer to use this repo.](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#loading-a-package-from-a-vcs-repository) 

## Usage

These wrappers use Guzzle and return the plain response for you to do what you want with.
Additional options to further parse the responses in the library will likely be added.

## License

These wrappers are licensed under the [MIT](LICENSE) license.

A lot of the documentation in this project comes directly from the NOAA APIs' documentation, which to the best of my knowledge is in the public domain.
